Your response goes here!

Ans 1)Through this project i have learnt a lot about the basic web developing language i.e. HTML(HyperText Markup Language).
How to use HTML,what are the syntax,how to use various HTML tags like <p>,<img>,<b>,<i> etc.
I also learnt how to use hyperlinking ,how to develop a basic HTML page and much more..

Ans 2)On the whole this project is fully on the easier side,specially because I was having some basic idea about how to use HTML tags.
As I had been given the full design mockup so it was easier to translate it to a webpage using HTML as it was properly explained through the videos regarding this project.

Ans 3)It was not a much difficult task to complete this project,but yes if I do not have any idea about the basic HTML then it might be a bit difficult for me to understand the basic idea of this project,but overall there is nothing much difficult about this project.

Ans 4)About the problem solving strategies,till the challenges so far not much strategic approach is needed but yes the basic thing is that I should not be fully dependent on what it had been taught through the videos but I should also explore the things myself for my better knowledge.
